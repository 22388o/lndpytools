# lndpytools
This repository is a collection of Python scripts that I use to manage my lightning node.

More scripts will be added over time and there is no guarantee of backwards compatibility.

## Usage

Download the repository
`$ git clone https://github.com/Gridflare/lndpytools.git`

Change into the new directory
`$ cd lndpytools`

Install requirements
`$ pip3 install -r requiments.txt --user`

Then grab a copy of `describgraph.json` if required, and run a script
`python3 improvecentrality.py`

You can download updates to the repo with `$ git pull`

Further documentation on each script is contained in the top section of each file.
